            <h2>Xinghai-square</h2>
            <p>Xinghai Square, Chinaâ€™s largest city square, harmonizes modern design with cultural heritage.<br>

                I enjoy visiting in the evening when the square lights up, creating a magical ambiance.<br>
                
                The vast open space is ideal for relaxation, with locals flying kites and engaging in outdoor activities.<br>
                
                First-time visitors should not miss the seaside promenade for breathtaking coastal views.
